title:过客

前言：此小诗创作于2017年，彼时我正处于人生的彷徨期，无人可诉说，更无人可倚靠，几年间多次求助和挣扎均以失败告终。
时间转眼过去，今天再看此诗，景情虽异，其思其动，仍能生动浮现，那种刺骨肤的记忆仿似昨天。
所幸在挚友陪伴与艰苦摸索中，寻到一丝精神的光亮，支撑至今日。
那时的忧虑与恐惧、排斥与敏感、内耗与压抑，大多已付笑谈。
我很感激。

Preface: This poem was written in 2017. At that time, I was in a period of hesitation in my life. I had no one to talk to, and no one to rely on. 
I had sought help and struggled many times in the past few years, but all ended in failure. 
Time has passed in a blink of an eye. 
When I read this poem again today, although the scene and mood are different, the thoughts and emotions can still emerge vividly, and the piercing memory seems like yesterday. 
Fortunately, with the company of close friend and tenacious growth, I found a ray of spiritual light that has supported me to this day. 
Most of the worries and fears, rejection and sensitivity, internal consumption and depression at that time, have become a joke now. 
I am very grateful of all this happened.


我从不知道地方的地方来
肩上的绳带和皮肉已分不出你我
我到了这个不明不暗的地方

I came from nowhere
The straps on my shoulders and skin make it hard to tell difference
I came to this vague place

一边仿佛是光亮 
另一边似乎是黑暗
光亮会刺痛我在黑暗中生长的眼眸
而黑暗则会把我吞没

One side seems to be bright
Another seems to be dark
The light will hurt my eyes that grew up in the darkness
And the darkness will swallow me up

我看着这条混沌边缘的路
稀零的尸骨仍旧不懂
黑暗的那边
到底是光明还是更深的黑暗
光亮的那边
到底是真正的光明还是另一个黑暗

I look at this road on the edge of chaos
The sparse corpses still don't understand
On the other side of darkness, is it light or a deeper darkness? 
On the other side of light, is it true light or another darkness?

除了我这个过客
已没有人还想去那个知道地方的地方

Except for me, a passer-by
no one wants to go to that place that everyone knows

肩上的细绳往血肉里陷入了一分
The straps deeper into my flesh
